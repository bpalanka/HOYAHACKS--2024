Getting Started

    To use LetsCookForUs, follow these simple steps:

1. Input Ingredients:

    As of now, begin by running the recipe.py file. It will open a page where you can input the ingredients and your allergies.

2. Specify Allergies:

    Let us know about any allergies you may have. Our goal with this project is to eventually include a place for users to input any diets they follow (such as vegetarian).
   
4. Click submit:
   
    This will display a list of recipes that match your ingredient list. The match percentage at the top is the proportion of the ingredients the user has over the ingredients needed for the recipe. This list is ordered based on the match percentage.

Places to improve:
1. Website instead of running through VScode
2. Allowing users to input specific dietary restrictions (not just allergies)
3. A larger and up-to-date database of recipes
